-Careful with the day counter for the benchmark averaging when not working in calendar days - maybe knock a bit off the start and end day counter as need be to account for proportionate days

-Active users uplift is not exact due to way the data is pulled from redshift (it takes exact hour/day periods and then splits these proportionally over the analysis hour/day periods)

-Not sure if the way of rolling forward benchmark by same % change in benchmark is the best way as it can lead to quite different outcomes when looking at different time periods
