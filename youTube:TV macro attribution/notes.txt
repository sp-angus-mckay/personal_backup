-Should count actual NGUs etc according to Madrid time? Problem then is making sure the benchmark is calculated over the same departs

-Could create a ‘list’ if user wants to select multiple countries to aggregate?? Aggregation may be important depending on how costs are segregated

-For active users analysis, note that total of the active users per hour will be higher than total of active users per day etc as one active user can be counted in several hour period as a unique user each hour, but will only be counted once over a 24 hour period in the daily analysis

-Active users uplift is not exact due to way the data is pulled from redshift (it takes exact hour/day periods and then splits these proportionally over the analysis hour/day periods)

-To compare active users to NGUs… i.e. want to separate uplift in active users due to NGUs to uplift due to reawakened users - can i directly take out the NGUs?

-Also think, does benchmark work ok with the way active users is done??

-Need to work out best way to represent revenues uplift. Simple to show standard uplift over expected, but also interesting to look at the revenues that the NGUs bring. Possibly need to concentrate on individual country here as RPI is different for different country etc.

-Could add an ‘if 0 then 1’ or ‘if 0 then take prev. number’ or something to the benchmark calculation to stop it breaking if it happens to be 0 on the campaign start hour/day/q_day
